        <p>Dont you think its a coincidance that you never seen me and miles morales in the same room(picture of me)? My name is Ati and my goals for this class is to learn something new. I dont really have any coding skills besides a python course that I took in grade 9. my hobbys are boxing and video games. valorant suckes,  best rank i got was gold 2. now i play rainbow six siege hard stuck bronze but r6 still better. also something recently that I found out is I am alergic to dust so i dont wanna hear no one complaining about how bad they have it.  </p>

            Here is a link to my culminating which i cooked on last minute clutchs you know how it is.
            my app allows you to pick and choose different outfit ideas that are listed in the app. here is a link to my repo <a class="project link" href="https://github.com/iceischilly/Fitbuilder.git">here.</a>
             This project was very challenging to me. the most challenging part was one of my group members leaving and me having to pick up his work after i was already done.
